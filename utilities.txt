Hi I am Atul 

Utilities I want to add.

The list is stored in the local storage of the user's browser.
The list starts to sync If the user opts for it.

Essentially How I want to implement is 
when user is connected to internet on both the devices
I want the sync process to happen `I don't know how to do it`
#ASSUMPTIONS
    It happens this way.
    Whichever device was last edited.
    We bring its data to both device.

%% PROBLEM
    If user changes some bits on both devices.
    I think then I might consider Appending 
    the list items based on the date and time.
